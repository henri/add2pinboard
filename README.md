# add2pinboard
command line interface - which for now just allows you to add things to pinboard via the API.

I have foundn a project 'pinboard-cli' which seems to be a CLI for everything but adding.
I found that after starting this project. Maybe a next step is to just fork that and add
some additional functionality.
